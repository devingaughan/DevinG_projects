# Using MicroMe

MicroMe has five main areas. These areas can be navigated to via the top and bottom navigation bars.
The areas are as follows:

## Homepage and Stats

The homepage is the page you are shown upon opening the app. From here, users are able to navigate 
to the other four areas.

The homepage displays a randomly chosen quote and monthly and lifetime statistics for water and
step entries. You can view these different stats by scrolling down on the screen. 

## About page

The about page is accessed after clicking on the Tangerine icon on the right of the top navigation
bar. From here you can read these pages! To navigate back, press the back arrow. 

## Water page

On the water page, you can change the goal by pressing on the "Change Goal" button. To add the amount
of water you drank, press the floating action button and input the amount of water drank. If the 
display does not update, switch to the home page and back to the water page.

## Steps page

On the steps page, you can view the number of steps you have taken under the "Steps Taken" label.
Below that is a progress bar that will show how close you are to reaching your step goal. To change
your goal amount, press the "Change Goal" button and input your new goal amount. To reset the amount
of steps taken, press the "Reset Steps" button. 

## Journal page

On the journal page, you can view and create new entries. To create an entry, press the floating
action button at the bottom and enter the title and body of your entry. After that, close the keyboard
and press the save button at the bottom of the screen. You should be taken back to the journal page
where you can now view your new entry. Tapping on this entry will allow you to view the entry. From
here, you can either press the edit icon to edit the file or the trash icon to delete the entry.
